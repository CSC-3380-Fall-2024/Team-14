# Team-14/Project Chronos

## Description

Project Chronos is a 2D platformer built in Godot using C#.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Godot
- \.\NET

You must have Godot 4.3 installed, and it must be the x86_64 version with dotnet/C# support. [The Godot downloads page](https://godotengine.org/download) has binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Additionally, you must also install the [NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) for your system.

### Clone the Repository

Once you have the correct version of the Godot Engine installed along with the .NET SDK and both are working properly on your system, clone the repository to your local system. You can do this with git through the command line, via tools in your IDE if possible, or with [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

Once you have the project, you can open it in Godot. Open Godot. It will prompt you to create or import a project. Select `Import Existing Project` and navigate to the folder called `projectchronos` inside the `Team-14` project folder. This will open the Godot project and allow you to build and run Project Chronos.

### Build and run

You can build and run the project by clicking the triangle 'play' button in the top right of the editor. You can also build the project without running by instead clicking the hammer icon on the left of it.

Building and running the project will open the current version of the game in a new window.

## Next Steps

Once you have opened and built the project once, it should be available as a listed option when you next open Godot. If you then select it, you can click `run` to execute the program, or you can click `edit` to open the project in the main editor.

While Godot has the capability to edit script files natively, it is recommended to use a third party, modern IDE for any C# code. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft is a good example.
